    Q2)Attached report snapshots for all the frameworks developed .

1 missing is the Javascipt framework ,as i had experience on protractor ,and as protractor met EOL ,so just created basic framework for Ui angular .
So ,have lost a bit of touch ,and therefore did the Ui automation using Java BDD Cucumber Page Object Model ,Maven Central Atrifactory .


Q2:have been sucessfully able  to solve the 1st usecase ,but remaining UI isnt supportable ,as the Ui changed .but in code i have added readme 
on how to run the gradle build and generate html BDD cucumber reports
